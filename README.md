## Contents

- Solutions to classic and advanced DSA problems
- Well-structured Java code for each problem
- Problems categorized by topic (arrays, strings, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Readable code with comments for better understanding

## How to Use

1. **Browse the repository:**  
   Navigate through the folders to find problems on specific DSA topics.

2. **Run the code:**  
   Each problem comes with a Java file. You can run these files using any Java IDE or command line.

3. **Practice and Learn:**  
   Study the solutions and try to solve the problems yourself before referring to the code.
